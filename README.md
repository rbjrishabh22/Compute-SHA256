Compute SHA256 Hash In C#
Hashing (also known as hash functions) in cryptography is a process of mapping a binary string of an arbitrary length to a small binary string of a fixed length, known as a hash value, a hash code, or a hash. Hash functions are a common way to protect secure sensitive data such as passwords and digital signatures. Some of the modern commonly-used hash functions are MD5, RIPEMD160, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512.
The NET framework provides cryptography-related functionality encapsulated in System.Security.Cryptography namespace and its classes.
It takes a byte array or stream as an input and returns a hash in the form of a byte array of 256 bits.
